# Case03 â€“ Facade to Process Sample

This sample demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline using the `AssemblyChainFacade` to:

1. Generate a minimal three-block assembly.
2. Solve the disassembly order via the CSP backend.
3. Export the result to the robotics `process.json` format.
4. Validate the output against `process.schema.json`.

## Prerequisites
- .NET 7 SDK.
- RhinoCommon dependency (restored transitively via the core project).

## Usage
```bash
cd samples/case-03
dotnet run
```

The app writes `output/process.json` and reports schema-validation status. Feel free to inspect the JSON or load it with the Python preview script in `docs/RobotBridge.md`.

## Sample Output Structure
```json

  "schemaVersion": "1.0.0",

> Actual runs include three steps (one per block) and real timestamps; the snippet above highlights the shape expected by downstream tools.
