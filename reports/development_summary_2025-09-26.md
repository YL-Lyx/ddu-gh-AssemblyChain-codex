### Development Summary (Date: 2025-09-26)

**Completed Tasks**
- Introduced AssemblyChain facade and new contracts for planning, datasets, process export and inference.
- Added robotic process schema, dataset exporter, ONNX inference stub and supporting documentation.
- Refactored Grasshopper Goo/Param classes and split MeshContactDetector, PlanarOps and MeshPreprocessor into partials.
- Established Windows quality workflow, smoke benchmarks, and created dataset/process samples.

**Current Project State**
- Architecture/Dependencies: Facade orchestrates solver, contact, dataset and robotics services.
- Solvers: BaseSolver delegates to OR-Tools stub with facade-driven selection.
- Robotic Execution: ProcessSchema exports JSON validated by `process.schema.json`.
- Engineering/CI: `quality.yml` executes build, tests and smoke benchmarks on Windows runners.
- Data & Learning: DatasetExporter and OnnxInferenceService enable future learning integrations.

**Issues Encountered**
- OR-Tools backend remains a stub due to environment limitations.

**Improvements & Insights**
- Centralising operations through the facade simplifies Grasshopper component code and future integrations.

**Next Targets**
- Implement production OR-Tools backend and expand benchmark coverage for contact detection.
