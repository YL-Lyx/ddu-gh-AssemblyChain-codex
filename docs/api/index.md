# API Reference

The API reference is generated from the `AssemblyChain.Core` and `AssemblyChain.Gh` projects. Use the namespace tree in the left-hand pane to discover classes, interfaces and extension methods that make up the planning and Grasshopper integration layers.

> **Tip:** The asynchronous methods introduced in this release appear alongside their synchronous counterparts. Prefer the `Async` variants when invoking the planning pipeline from UI threads to keep Grasshopper responsive.
